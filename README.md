# A case-control study of the cryptojacking ecosystem
A repository containing data and scripts about websites performing cryptojacking

### Data
Inside the 'Data' folder you can find the list of websites, in the Top 7.5M Tranco list (more information on Tranco [here](https://tranco-list.eu/)), that were detected to perform cryptojacking using the [Minesweeper](https://github.com/vusec/minesweeper) tool.
You will also find information about the technical characteristics of the website in terms of server and CMS type, as well as other publicly available information collected by interacting with the website.

### Scripts
Inside the 'Scripts' folder you can find the Matlab script utilized to compute plots and statistics about the case and control group.

The paper that describes more details appears at IEEE Workshop on Attackers and Cyber Crime Operations (WACCO) at EuroS&P2020. You can find it [here](https://giorgioditizio.github.io/papers/cryptojacking_wacco2020.pdf).
